        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <h3>Anima 2B Style Explorer: The Ultimate Visual Guide for AI Artists</h3>
        <p>Anima 2B Style Explorer is an interactive visual database designed to unlock the full potential of the Anima 2B parameter model by CircleStone Labs. This tool serves as a bridge between complex AI training data and creative prompt engineering, featuring a curated collection of over 900+ artist styles indexed from the Danbooru ecosystem.</p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standardized Visual Benchmarking:</strong> Every preview is generated using a fixed control prompt. This allows you to compare brushwork, lighting, and composition across thousands of artists without distracting variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Dataset Transparency:</strong> We display the Approximate Training Image Count for each style. This number represents the volume of data the model processed for a specific tag, helping you predict the "strength" and stability of a style.</li>
            <li><strong>One-Click Integration:</strong> Optimized for the Anima 2B model's unique syntax, our explorer allows you to copy the required @artist-name tags instantly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Powered by Anima 2B & Danbooru</h3>
        <p>The Anima 2B model represents a breakthrough in high-fidelity anime and artistic generation. Trained on millions of illustrations and over 800k high-quality images, it moves beyond synthetic data to capture the soul of genuine human creativity.</p>
        <p>By utilizing Danbooru-based tagging, Anima allows for surgical precision in style application. Anima 2B Style Explorer organizes these tags into an intuitive interface, making it the premier resource for artists, hobbyists, and AI researchers using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI.</p>
        <h3>Why Use Anima 2B Style Explorer?</h3>
        <p>In the world of AI generation, knowing the right "token" is only half the battle. Understanding how that token influences the final image is what separates a good prompt from a masterpiece.</p>
