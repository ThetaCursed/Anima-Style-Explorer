# Anima 2B Style Explorer 🎨

An interactive, high-performance visual database designed to explore artist styles within the **Anima 2B parameter model**. 

## 🚀 Overview
The **Anima 2B Style Explorer** is a specialized tool for AI artists and prompt engineers. It provides a standardized way to benchmark how the **Anima 2B model** (by CircleStone Labs) interprets specific artist influences from the **Danbooru** dataset.

Instead of guessing, you can now visually verify every style before you hit "Generate".

## ✨ Current Status: Phase 2
- **Current Library:** 5,000+ artist previews.
- **Roadmap:** Expanding to a comprehensive database of 20,000+ artist tags.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Visual Benchmarking:** Every artist is tested against a fixed control prompt for fair comparison.
- **Optimized for Anima 2B:** Features the specific `@artist-name` syntax required for the model.
- **Dataset Insights:** Includes approximate training image counts to help predict style "strength".
- **Performance First:** - Ultra-lightweight Vanilla JS architecture.
  - Optimized WebP images for instant loading.
